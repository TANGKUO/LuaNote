###Crossfade
   
   This sample demonstrates cross-fading between two overlapping views.
   
   ```
    /**
     * Cross-fades between {@link #mContentView} and {@link #mLoadingView}.
     */
    private void showContentOrLoadingIndicator(boolean contentLoaded) {
        // Decide which view to hide and which to show.
        final View showView = contentLoaded ? mContentView : mLoadingView;
        final View hideView = contentLoaded ? mLoadingView : mContentView;

        // Set the "show" view to 0% opacity but visible, so that it is visible
        // (but fully transparent) during the animation.
        showView.setAlpha(0f);
        showView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);

        // Animate the "show" view to 100% opacity, and clear any animation listener set on
        // the view. Remember that listeners are not limited to the specific animation
        // describes in the chained method calls. Listeners are set on the
        // ViewPropertyAnimator object for the view, which persists across several
        // animations.
        showView.animate()
                .alpha(1f)
                .setDuration(mShortAnimationDuration)
                .setListener(null);

        // Animate the "hide" view to 0% opacity. After the animation ends, set its visibility
        // to GONE as an optimization step (it won't participate in layout passes, etc.)
        hideView.animate()
                .alpha(0f)
                .setDuration(mShortAnimationDuration)
                .setListener(new AnimatorListenerAdapter() {
                    @Override
                    public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animation) {
                        hideView.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                    }
                });
    }
```
